**Version Control Simulation SBA**

**Overview**

This a class project for a (SBA) that simulates version control concepts using a static HTML interface and Git for version control. Hosted on GitHub, it demonstrates Git workflows, including branching, merging, pull requests, and conflict resolution, to mimic a simplified version control system.

What is Version Control?
Version control tracks changes to files, enabling collaboration, history management, and error recovery. Git is a distributed version control system used in modern development for its robust branching, merging, and integration with GitHub for collaborative workflows.

**Features**
HTML Interface: Displays a navigation menu, project description, and simulated commit log.
Git Workflows: Full Git usage for repository management, change tracking, and history.
GitHub Integration: Remote repository with push/pull, branches, pull requests, and conflict resolution.File Management: Command-line operations for creating and organizing project files.

**Technologies**
Frontend: HTML
Version Control: Git, GitHub
